# Loading Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was stuck on loading when refreshing the page due to profile loading blocking the authentication initialization.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Non-blocking Profile Loading**
- Changed profile loading to not block the main auth initialization
- Profile loads in the background after auth state is set
- Added `.catch(console.error)` to handle profile loading errors gracefully

### 2. **Safety Timeout**
- Added 15-second safety timeout to prevent infinite loading
- Forces `setLoading(false)` if initialization takes too long
- Timeout is cleared when component unmounts

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Added timeout protection to `loadUserProfile` function (10-second timeout)
- Enhanced error handling in `profileService.getUserProfile`
- Graceful fallback when profile table doesn't exist yet

### 4. **Debug Logging**
- Added console logs to track initialization progress
- Helps identify where the loading might be getting stuck
- Can be removed in production

## Key Changes Made

### AuthContext.tsx:
- Made profile loading non-blocking
- Added safety timeout
- Enhanced error handling
- Added debug logging

### profileService.ts:
- Better error handling for missing tables
- Graceful fallback when profile table doesn't exist
- Warning instead of error for expected cases

## What This Fixes

✅ **No more infinite loading** - Safety timeout ensures loading never gets stuck
✅ **Faster initialization** - Profile loading doesn't block auth state
✅ **Better error handling** - Graceful fallback when database isn't fully set up
✅ **Debug visibility** - Console logs help track initialization

## Testing

After these changes:
1. The app should load quickly even if the profile table doesn't exist
2. Profile features will work once the database migration is run
3. Debug logs in console will show initialization progress
4. No more stuck loading states on refresh

## Next Steps

1. **Run the migration** - Use `display-name-migration.sql` to set up the profile table
2. **Test the features** - Display name editing should work after migration
3. **Remove debug logs** - Optional, remove console.log statements for production

The app should now load properly even before running the database migration!
