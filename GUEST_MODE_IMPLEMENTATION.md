# Guest Mode Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added "Continue as Guest" functionality that allows users to use the MCQ Quiz Taker without creating an account. In guest mode, all data (API keys, settings) is stored locally in the browser using localStorage.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Guest Mode Authentication
- **Continue as Guest button** on the authentication screen
- **Guest Profile component** for users in guest mode
- **Local storage** for API keys and settings
- **Session persistence** - guest mode persists across browser sessions

### 2. Enhanced UI Components

#### AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Added `isGuest` state management
- Added `continueAsGuest()` and `exitGuestMode()` functions
- Guest mode detection on app startup
- Local storage integration for guest state

#### QuizApp (`src/components/QuizApp.tsx`)
- Updated authentication flow to include guest option
- "Continue as Guest" button with visual separator
- Conditional rendering based on user/guest state
- Profile component switching (UserProfile vs GuestProfile)

#### GuestProfile (`src/components/GuestProfile.tsx`)
- **NEW COMPONENT**: Dropdown profile for guest users
- Shows "Guest User" status
- "Sign Up / Sign In" option to exit guest mode
- Guest Mode badge indicator
- Clean, intuitive interface

#### MobileNavToggle (`src/components/MobileNavToggle.tsx`)
- Added support for guest mode in mobile navigation
- Conditional profile display (UserProfile or GuestProfile)
- Updated state management to include `isGuest`

#### GeminiAI (`src/components/GeminiAI.tsx`)
- **Dual storage system**: Supabase for authenticated users, localStorage for guests
- Updated API key loading/saving logic
- Guest-aware error messaging
- Seamless experience regardless of authentication state

#### QuizSettings (`src/components/QuizSettings.tsx`)
- **Three-state alerts**:
  - 🟢 **Authenticated**: "Secure Storage Active" (cloud encryption)
  - 🔵 **Guest Mode**: "Local storage mode" (browser only)
  - 🟡 **Not Signed In**: "Sign in required" (prompt to authenticate)

## User Experience

### Guest Mode Benefits
- ✅ **No account required** - immediate access to app
- ✅ **Privacy focused** - no personal data collected
- ✅ **Local storage** - data stays on device
- ✅ **Full functionality** - all quiz features available
- ✅ **Easy upgrade path** - can sign up anytime

### Guest Mode Limitations
- ⚠️ **Device-specific** - data doesn't sync across devices
- ⚠️ **Browser-dependent** - clearing browser data removes settings
- ⚠️ **No cloud backup** - data loss if browser data is cleared

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Strategy
```typescript
// Guest Mode: localStorage
localStorage.setItem('gemini_api_key', apiKey)
localStorage.setItem('guest_mode', 'true')

// Authenticated: Supabase with encryption
await supabaseSecureStorage.storeApiKey(apiKey)
```

### State Management
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null
  isGuest: boolean
  continueAsGuest: () => void
  exitGuestMode: () => void
  // ...other auth methods
}
```

### UI Flow
1. **Landing Page**: Sign In / Sign Up / Continue as Guest
2. **Guest Mode**: GuestProfile dropdown with upgrade option
3. **Settings**: Clear status indicators for storage type
4. **Mobile**: Guest profile in navigation sidebar

## Security Considerations

### Guest Mode Security
- ✅ **Local storage only** - no network transmission
- ✅ **Browser sandboxing** - isolated from other sites
- ✅ **No server storage** - no data retention risk
- ✅ **User control** - can clear data anytime

### Data Migration
- When guest upgrades to account, they'll need to re-enter API key
- Future enhancement: could implement data migration flow

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/components/GuestProfile.tsx` - Guest user profile component

### Modified Files
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added guest mode state and functions
- `src/components/QuizApp.tsx` - Updated auth flow with guest option
- `src/components/MobileNavToggle.tsx` - Added guest profile support
- `src/components/GeminiAI.tsx` - Dual storage system implementation
- `src/components/QuizSettings.tsx` - Three-state storage alerts

## Testing Scenarios

### Guest Mode Flow
1. Visit app → Click "Continue as Guest"
2. Enter API key → Save (stored in localStorage)
3. Create quiz → API key works from localStorage
4. Refresh browser → Still in guest mode with saved API key
5. Click profile → See "Guest User" with upgrade option

### Authenticated Flow
1. Sign up/in → API key saved to Supabase
2. Sign out → Switch to auth screen
3. Continue as guest → Different profile, local storage

### Mixed Usage
1. Use as guest → Save API key locally
2. Sign up → API key cleared, need to re-enter
3. Sign out → Return to guest mode, original API key restored

This implementation provides a complete guest experience while maintaining the security benefits of authenticated storage for users who choose to create accounts.
